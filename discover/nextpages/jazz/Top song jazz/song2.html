              <p>And now, the end is near</p>
              <p>And so I face the final curtain</p>
              <p>My friend, I'll say it clear</p>
              <p>I'll state my case, of which I'm certain</p>
              <p>I've lived a life that's full</p>
              <p>I traveled each and every highway</p>
              <p>And more, much more than this</p>
              <p>I did it my way</p>
              <p>Regrets, I've had a few</p>
              <p>But then again, too few to mention</p>
              <p>I did what I had to do</p>
              <p>And saw it through without exemption</p>
              <p>I planned each charted course</p>
              <p>Each careful step along the byway</p>
              <p>And more, much more than this</p>
              <p>I did it my way</p>
              <p>Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew</p>
              <p>When I bit off more than I could chew</p>
              <p>But through it all, when there was doubt</p>
              <p>I ate it up and spit it out</p>
              <p>I faced it all, and I stood tall</p>
              <p>And did it my way</p>
              <p>I've loved, I've laughed and cried</p>
              <p>I've had my fill, my share of losing</p>
              <p>And now, as tears subside</p>
              <p>I find it all so amusing</p>
              <p>To think I did all that</p>
              <p>And may I say, not in a shy way</p>
              <p>Oh, no, oh, no, not me</p>
              <p>I did it my way</p>
              <p>For what is a man, what has he got?</p>
              <p>If not himself, then he has naught</p>
              <p>To say the things he truly feels</p>
              <p>And not the words of one who kneels</p>
              <p>The record shows I took the blows</p>
              <p>And did it my way</p>
              <p>Yes, it was my way</p>
