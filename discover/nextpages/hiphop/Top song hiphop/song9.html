              <p>[Intro]</p>
              <p>Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity</p>
              <p>To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment</p>
              <p>Would you capture it or just let it slip?</p>
              <p>Yo</p>
              <p>[Verse 1]</p>
              <p>His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy</p>
              <p>There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti</p>
              <p>He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready</p>
              <p>To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting</p>
              <p>What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud</p>
              <p>He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out</p>
              <p>He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now</p>
              <p>The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow</p>
              <p>Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity</p>
              <p>Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad</p>
              <p>But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it</p>
              <p>He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter</p>
              <p>He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant</p>
              <p>
                He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
              </p>
              <p>Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody</p>
              <p>Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>[Chorus]</p>
              <p>You better lose yourself in the music</p>
              <p>The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)</p>
              <p>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p>
              <p>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo</p>
              <p>You better lose yourself in the music</p>
              <p>The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)</p>
              <p>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p>
              <p>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo</p>

              <p>[Verse 2]</p>
              <p>His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping</p>
              <p>This world is mine for the taking, make me king</p>
              <p>As we move toward a new world order</p>
              <p>A normal life is boring, but superstardom's</p>
              <p>Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder</p>
              <p>Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over</p>
              <p>These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows</p>
              <p>He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads</p>
              <p>God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father</p>
              <p>He goes home and barely knows his own daughter</p>
              <p>But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water</p>
              <p>These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product</p>
              <p>They moved on to the next schmoe who flows</p>
              <p>He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera</p>
              <p>Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner</p>
              <p>But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah</p>
              <p>[Chorus]</p>
              <p>You better lose yourself in the music</p>
              <p>The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)</p>
              <p>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p>
              <p>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo</p>
              <p>You better lose yourself in the music</p>
              <p>The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)</p>
              <p>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p>
              <p>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo</p>
              <p>You better</p>
              <p>[Verse 3]</p>
              <p>No more games, I'ma change what you call rage</p>
              <p>Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged</p>
              <p>I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed</p>
              <p>I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage</p>
              <p>But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher</p>
              <p>Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper</p>
              <p>All the pain inside amplified by the</p>
              <p>Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-</p>
              <p>
                Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
              </p>
              <p>'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers</p>
              <p>
                And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
              </p>
              <p>And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder</p>
              <p>Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter</p>
              <p>Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna</p>
              <p>Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna</p>
              <p>Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me</p>
              <p>To the point I'm like a snail, I've got</p>
              <p>To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot</p>
              <p>Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not</p>
              <p>Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got</p>
              <p>To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot</p>
              <p>So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not</p>
              <p>This may be the only opportunity that I got</p>
              <p>[Chorus]</p>
              <p>You better lose yourself in the music</p>
              <p>The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)</p>
              <p>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p>
              <p>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo</p>
              <p>You better lose yourself in the music</p>
              <p>The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)</p>
              <p>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p>
              <p>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo</p>
              <p>You better</p>
