                                <p>Jesus died for somebody's sins, but not mine</p>
                                <p>Melting in a pot of thieves, wild card up my sleeve</p>
                                <p>Thick, heart of stone, my sins, my own</p>
                                <p>They belong to me, me</p>
                                <p>People said, "Beware", but I don't care</p>
                                <p>Their words are just rules and regulations to me, me</p>
                                <p>I walk in a room, you know I look so proud</p>
                                <p>I move in this here atmosphere where anything's allowed</p>
                                <p>Then I go to this here party and I just get bored</p>
                                <p>Until I look out the window, see a sweet young thing</p>
                                <p>Humping on a parking meter, leaning on the parking meter</p>
                                <p>Oh, she looks so good, oh, she looks so fine</p>
                                <p>And I've got this crazy feeling that I'm going to, ah-ah, make her mine</p>
                                <p>Oh, I'll put my spell on her, here she comes</p>
                                <p>Walking down the street, here she comes</p>
                                <p>Coming through my door, here she comes</p>
                                <p>Crawling up my stair, here she comes</p>
                                <p>Waltzing through the hall in a pretty red dress</p>
                                <p>And oh, she looks so good, oh, she looks so fine</p>
                                <p>And I've got this crazy feeling that I'm going to, ah-ah, make her mine</p>
                                <p>Then I hear this knocking on my door</p>
                                <p>Hear this knocking on my door</p>
                                <p>And I look up to the big tower clock and say, "Oh my God, it's midnight"</p>
                                <p>And my baby is walking through the door laying on my couch</p>
                                <p>She whispers to me and I take the big plunge</p>
                                <p>And oh, she was so good, ooh</p>
                                <p>And oh, she was so fine</p>
                                <p>And I'm going to tell the world that I just, ah-ah, made her mine</p>
                                <p>And I said darling, tell me your name, she told me her name</p>
                                <p>She whispered to me, she told me her name</p>
                                <p>And her name is, and her name is</p>
                                <p>And her name is, and her name is</p>
                                <p>G-L-O-R-I-</p>

                                <p>I was at the stadium</p>
                                <p>There were 20 thousand girls</p>
                                <p>Called their names out to me</p>
                                <p>Marie, Ruth, but to tell you the truth</p>
                                <p>I didn't hear them, I didn't see</p>
                                <p>I let my eyes rise to the big tower clock</p>
                                <p>And I heard those bells chiming in my heart going</p>
                                <p>Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong</p>
                                <p>Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong</p>
                                <p>Calling the time when you came to my room</p>
                                <p>And you whispered to me, and we took the big plunge</p>
                                <p>And oh, you were so good, ooh</p>
                                <p>Oh, you were so fine</p>
                                <p>And I've got to tell the world that I made ya mine, made ya mine</p>
                                <p>Made her mine made ya mine made her mine made ya mine</p>

                                <p>When the tower bells chime</p>
                                <p>Ding-dong they chime</p>
                                <p>I said that Jesus died for somebody's sins</p>
                                <p>But not mine</p>
