                        <p>I can't remember the last time</p>
                        <p>   You looked as happy as you did tonight</p>
                        <p>   Your tipsy friend grabbed that bartender</p>
                        <p>   Gave him her phone and pulled us over there with her</p>
                        <p>  He counted to three</p>
                        <p>   And, baby, I haven't seen that side of you in forever</p>
                        <p>   And I hate it's the truth</p>
                        <p>   But baby, you never do when we're alone together</p>
                        <p>   It was good to see you smile</p>
                        <p>   Girl, you know it's been a while</p>
                        <p>   It was good to see you smile</p>
                        <p>   Even if it was just for the picture</p>
                            <p>   They say a picture's worth a thousand words</p>
                            <p>    But you ain't said one since you woke up</p>
                            <p>   Silly me, thinkin' we could make it work</p>
                            <p>    Can you blame me for getting my hopes up?</p>
                            <p>    You know it took me right back to how it used to be</p>
                            <p>   Baby, seeing us like that is still a little bittersweet</p>
                            <p>   But it was good to see you smile</p>
                            <p>  Girl, you know it's been a while</p>
                            <p>   It was good to see you smile</p>
                            <p>  Even if it was just for the picture</p>
                            <p>  If someone were to see this they'd think everything's alright</p>
                            <p>  At least we got a pretty little moment frozen in time</p>
                            <p>   It was good to see you smile</p>
                            <p>   Girl, you know it's been a while</p>
                            <p>  It was good to see you smile</p>
