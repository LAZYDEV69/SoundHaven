                        <p>Love was a game, I played dealer's choice</p>
                        <p>  In the back of a bar all summer</p>
                        <p>   Forgetting names like background noise</p>
                            <p>   In relationships I wanted none of</p>
                            <p>   Went off the rails by fall</p>

                            <p>   Wore off the alcohol</p>
                            <p>   And you were there like an angel waiting</p>
                            <p>   I didn't know you'd have brown eyes</p>
                            <p>    Like to pray to Jesus</p>
                            <p>    Spending Friday nights at home</p>
                            <p>   Didn't know you'd be the strong kind</p>
                            <p>   Deeper than a coal mine</p>
                            <p>    Lovin' with a heart of gold</p>

                            <p>   Made a living dipping toes in the water</p>
                            <p>   Feelin' low with my walls up high</p>
                            <p>  I was staying far away from the deep end</p>
                            <p>   Girl like you made a boy like me try</p>
                            <p>   Went off the rails that fall</p>

                            <p>  I'll sing your praises every way</p>
                            <p>   Like the hymnals all say</p>
