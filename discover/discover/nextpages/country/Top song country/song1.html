                        <p>There's a man on TV, at a desk in a suit
                            <p>    He lies through his teeth and they still call it the news</p>
                            <p>    There's a man in a white coat, whose medicine kills</p>
                            <p>    He loves when you're sick, 'cause you pay for his pills</p>
                            <p>    There's a man at the bank, who will give you a loan</p>
                            <p>    So, that you'll buy a house, and then he'll take your home</p>
                            <p>    There's a man who wants you spending your life online</p>
                            <p>    'Cause you're searching for truth, but controls what you find</p>
                            <p>    We'll be fine bae, if we don't make it through</p>
                            <p>    There's a man, in a church, who I really hope told me the truth</p>
                            <p>    Said there's a man in the sky, watching over me and you</p>
                            <p>    It don't help if you can fly, He's way past the moon</p>
                            <p>    And there's men here on the ground, that just wanna burn it down</p>
                            <p>    They want money, they want power, don't want no one else allowed</p>
                            <p>    We'll be fine bae, I'll be the man for you</p>
                            <p>    There's a man in the courts, sworn to uphold the law</p>
                            <p>     But he's crooked as a fence post, and don't do his job</p>
                            <p>   There's a man in a classroom, who should know the facts</p>
                            <p>    But he's brainwashin' kids, teaching English and Math</p>
                            <p>    There's a man in your phone, who hears everything you say</p>
                            <p>     He knows everywhere you go, every joke you ever made</p>
                            <p>     There's a man with a bloodline, that owns the whole world</p>
                            <p>    Every airplane, and building, and gold brick, and pearl</p>
                            <p>    We'll be fine bae, if we don't make it through (ooh, ooh)</p>
                            <p>    There's a man, in a church, who I really hope told me the truth</p>
                            <p>    Said there's a man in the sky, watching over me and you</p>
                            <p>    It don't help if you can fly, He's way past the moon</p>
                            <p>    And there's men here on the ground, that just wanna burn it down</p>
                            <p>    They want money, they want power, don't want no one else allowed</p>
                            <p>    We'll be fine bae, I'll be the man for you</p>
                            <p>    Pray that the man in the sky's watching over us tonight</p>
                            <p>    'Cause there's people looking down on us for fighting for what's right</p>
                            <p>    Hold the line bae, and I'll hold on to you</p>
                            <p>    There's a man in the clouds, and I hope He's looking down</p>
                            <p>    'Cause there's people here on Earth who tryna put us in the ground</p>
                            <p>    We'll be fine bae, I won't let go of you</p>
                            <p>    Said there's a man in the sky, watching over me and you</p>
                            <p>    It don't help if you can fly, He's way past the moon</p>
                            <p>    And there's men here on the ground, that just wanna burn it down</p>
                            <p>    They want money, they want power, don't want no one else allowed</p>
                            <p>    We'll be fine bae, I'll be the man for you</p>
