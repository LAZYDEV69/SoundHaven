                                        <p>This is Wyclef, Refugee Camp (L-Boogie up in here)</p>
                                        <p>Praswell (Praswell up in here, haha)</p>
                                        <p>Lil' Base sittin' up here on the bass (Refugees up in here)</p>
                                        <p>While I'm on this, I got my girl L (ah, ah)</p>
                                        <p>One time (one time), one time (one time)</p>
                                        <p>Ayo, L, you know you got the lyrics</p>
                                        <p>I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style</p>
                                        <p>And so I came to see him, and listen for a while</p>
                                        <p>And there he was, this young boy, stranger to my eyes</p>
                                        <p>Strumming my pain with his fingers (one time, one time)</p>

                                        <p>Killing me softly with his song</p>
                                        <p>I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd</p>
                                        <p>I felt he'd found my letters and read each one out loud</p>
                                        <p>I prayed that he would finish, but he just kept right on</p>
