              <p>Great Aunt Maurine said at a hundred and three</p>
              <p>Write scripture on your heart for when you need it</p>
              <p>'Cause anxiety hates Psalm 23</p>
              <p>So just say it to yourself 'til you believe it</p>
              <p>And I'm feeling like I'm needing it right now</p>
              <p>The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want</p>
              <p>He leads me by still waters 'til my fears are gone</p>
              <p>Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death</p>
              <p>Oh, I know You are with me, my Father, my friend</p>
              <p>Your goodness and mercy will follow me all of my days</p>
              <p>I know by Your still waters, I'm safe</p>
              <p>Lord, I believe You can set me at ease</p>
              <p>Turn this broken piece in me to peace and quiet</p>
              <p>I know there's power in Your word</p>
              <p>So I'll say it over and over 'til my soul's reminded</p>
              <p>Oh, The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want</p>
              <p>He leads me by still waters 'til my fears are gone</p>
              <p>Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death</p>
              <p>Oh, I know You are with me, my Father, my friend</p>
              <p>Your goodness and mercy will follow me all of my days</p>
              <p>I know by Your still waters, I'm safe</p>
              <p>Still waters run through any valley I could find</p>
              <p>I'm laying fear down here at Heaven's riverside</p>
              <p>Your word has been true in every season of my life</p>
              <p>
                I believe, yes, I believe still waters run through any valley I
                could find
              </p>
              <p>I'm laying fear down here at Heaven's riverside</p>
              <p>Your word has been true in every season of my life</p>
              <p>I believe, yes, I believe</p>
              <p>Oh, The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want</p>
              <p>He leads me by still waters 'til my fears are gone</p>
              <p>Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death</p>
              <p>Oh, I know You are with me, my Father, my friend</p>
              <p>Your goodness and mercy will follow me all of my days</p>
