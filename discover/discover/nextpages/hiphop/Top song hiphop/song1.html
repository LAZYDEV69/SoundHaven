                            <p>    Atlanta was the Mecca, building railroads and trains</p>
                            <p>   Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game</p>
                            <p>   The settlers was using town folk to make 'em richer</p>
                            <p>   Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda</p>
                            <p>  You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance</p>
                            <p>   Let me break it down for you, this the real n!gga challenge</p>
                            <p>   You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)</p>
                            <p>  Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)</p>
                            <p>   21 gave you false street cred</p>
                            <p>   Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)</p>
                            <p>   Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)</p>
                            <p>   2 Chainz say you good, but he lied</p>
                            <p>  You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars</p>
                            <p>   No, you not a colleague, you a f**king colonizer</p>
                            <p>  The family matter, and the truth of the matter, it was God's plan to show y'all the liar</p>
                            <p>  Mmm</p>
                            <p>  Mmm-mmm</p>
