<p>(Ooh) If you tried just a little more times</p>
<p>I would've made you a believer</p>
<p>Would've showed you what it's like (I would've showed you)</p>
<p>Every single night (Night)</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Verse 1: LISA & RAYE]</p>
<p>In the car, top down, black shades on, uh (Lookin' so good, can I add?)</p>
<p>And I just broke up with my man, like mm (A very, very silly, silly man)</p>
<p>One ex in the passenger seat 'cause I'm done (Done, yeah, never, ever goin' back)</p>
<p>Down, down, rude boy, get your foot up on my dash</p>
<p>Got all the receipts, I'm a businesswoman</p>
<p>Littlе bit of heartbreak</p>
<p>A little bit of "How could you do that?"</p>
<p>A littlе bit of talkin' out your ass</p>
<p>A little bit of "Look at what you had but could not hold"</p>
<p>And that's on you, baby, too bad</p>
<p>I'm about to make it heard as I vroom-vroom</p>
<p>Ice-cold how I leave you 'lone, but please</p>
<p>Tell your mother I'ma miss her so</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Chorus: RAYE & LISA]</p>
<p>If you tried just a little more times</p>
<p>I would've made you a believer</p>
<p>Would've showed you what it's like (Like)</p>
<p>Every single night</p>
<p>To be born again, baby, to be born again</p>
<p>If you stayed just another few nights</p>
<p>I could've made you pray to Jesus</p>
<p>Would've showed you to the light (To the light)</p>
<p>Every single night (Every night)</p>
<p>To be born again, baby, to be born again</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Verse 2: Doja Cat]</p>
<p>Non-believer</p>
<p>You've bitten from the fruit but can't give back</p>
<p>Nice to leave ya</p>
<p>But I would be a fool not to ask</p>
<p>Do your words seem gospel to ya now? (Your words seem gospel to you now?)</p>
<p>Keepin' me strong</p>
<p>Choosin' to carry on after one</p>
<p>Too many lies would be wrong, so wrong</p>
<p>Said, he popped tags on my shoppin' spree</p>
<p>Stayed mad when I showed him all the long receipts</p>
<p>They laugh, but you crashed out like a comedy</p>
<p>I can't be your sugar mom, get a job for me, shit</p>
<p>(Ah, so) Boy, let go</p>
<p>Or let me live happily forever after more</p>
<p>I hope you learned somethin' from a lil' fiasco</p>
<p>You played the game smart lettin' lil' me pass go 'cause</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Chorus: LISA & RAYE]</p>
<p>If you tried just a little more times</p>
<p>I would've made you a believer</p>
<p>Would've showed you what it's like (Like)</p>
<p>Every single night (Night)</p>
<p>To be born again, baby, to be born again</p>
<p>If you stayed just another few nights</p>
<p>I could've made you pray to Jesus</p>
<p>Would've showed you to the light (To the light)</p>
<p>Every single night (Every night)</p>
<p>To be born again, baby, to be born again</p>
<p>[Bridge: RAYE]</p>
<p>Seasoned like the cinnamon the way I'm gettin' rid of him</p>
<p>I'm only gonna make you need religion at the minimum</p>
<p>And I'ma do it diligent, I'm lookin' for a synonym</p>
<p>I'm tryna find the words to tell him I ain't even feelin' him (I pray)</p>
<p>Don't ever let me be deficient in</p>
<p>Wish that you could wake up and then take me like a vitamin</p>
<p>I learned the hard way to let go now to save my soul (Oh)</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Chorus: RAYE & LISA, LISA, RAYE]</p>
<p>If you tried just a little more times</p>
<p>I would've made you a believer</p>
<p>Would've showed you what it's like (Like)</p>
<p>Every single night</p>
<p>To be born again, baby, to be born again</p>

<p>Every single night (Every night)</p>
<p>To be born again, baby, to be born again</p>
<p></p>
<p>[Outro: LISA, LISA & RAYE]</p>
<p>Baby, to be born, oh, baby, baby, to be born again</p>
<p>To be born again, baby, to be born again</p>
<p>Baby, to be born, oh, baby, baby, to be born again (Yeah)</p>
<p>To be born again, baby, to be born again</p>
