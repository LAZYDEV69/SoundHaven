                                        <p>It's all good when you're little, you have pure fun</p>
                                        <p>Can't be a fool, son, what about the long run?</p>

                                        <p>Could have left, but I called and you heeded</p>
                                        <p>Begged and I pleaded mission completed</p>
                                        <p>Mama said that I and I dissed the program</p>
                                        <p>Not the type to mess around with your emotion</p>
                                        <p>But the feeling that I have for you is so strong</p>
